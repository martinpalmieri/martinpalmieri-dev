# Mart√≠n Palmieri

Hey, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Royal Schiphol Group with a background in Engineering Management. I've had the opportunity to lead and mentor teams in the past, and I'm passionate about continuing to grow in that role. I enjoy working with React.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences.
