## Development

This project targets Node.js 20.11.1 (see `.nvmrc`). After installing dependencies with `npm install`, the most common workflows are:

- `npm run dev` – start the local development server.
- `npm run build` – generate the production build used for deployment.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint across Astro, TypeScript, and JavaScript sources.
- `npm run typecheck` – execute `astro check` for framework and TypeScript diagnostics.
